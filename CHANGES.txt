Changes
-------

 v1.9.1
  - Fixed a nasty bug introduced on the transparent antialiased mode

 v1.9.0
  - Improved a 25-30% the drawing speed of all modes thanks to Doug Eleveld
  - Improved a 50% the drawing speed of antialiased transparent
    thanks to a tip of Doug Eleveld
  - Updated FreeType lib to v2.1.3, which brings better quality font
    rendering, mostly in antialised mode


 v1.8.2
  - Fixed some calls to malloc(0) when a character didn't have an image
    attached (for example, usually the space character)
  - Added _ex versions of textout that take the background parameter directly

 v1.8.1
  - Henrik Schmidt found a bug in the antialiased opaque rendered giving
    non accurate results, now fixed

 v1.8.0
  - Henrik Schmidt found a bug, that alfont_is_scalable_font() and
    alfont_is_fixed_font() returned 1 on true instead of TRUE
  - Henrik Schmidt found another bug related with the fonts showing
    very very far from the top point, fixed too
  - Had to change the size change system, now it will only accept heights
  - Made the height more accurate to the given parameters (the resulting
    font of height x was usually bigger than asked)
  - Improved the fixed font handling and loading of bitmap fonts without
    antialiasing (now it shouldn't have errors or memory leaks when using
    old fonts like PDF)
  - Added functions to modify the character spacing
  - Changed the version scheme, now it uses x.y.z being 'x' used for big
    changes, 'y' used for normal changes and 'z' for small changes like
    bugfixes

 v1.7
  - Changed the license from LGPL to the FreeType Project License (a lot
    less restrictive)
  - Added options to create the lib as a DLL, please read the README.txt
    file again for further instructions. Deleted the ML and MT models in
    MSVC, since this lib needs Allegro and Allegro is only built in MD
    mode.
  - Added some more compability with fixed sized fonts and some functions
    to manage them like alfont_get_available_fixed_sizes() and more (check
    the docs)

 v1.6
  - Awesome speed increase (even a 1700% in some cases!!!)

 v1.5
  - Updated FreeType lib to v2.0.9
  - Added a check in alfont_set_font_size() to not reload the glyphs
    if the font is already with the desired size and alfont_get_width()
    and alfont_get_font_height() as suggested by Marcin Jakubowski
  - Added a simple cache system so the load and resize of fonts work a
    whole lot faster
  - Added an example inside the examples directory (example1)

 v1.4
  - Updated FreeType lib to v2.0.8
  - Changed the makefiles to make it compatible with gcc 3.0.x

 v1.3
  - Fixed a big bug that generated some random crashes when loading
    a font from memory
  - Added define ALFONT_ERROR and changed the return value of the
    alfont_set_font_size() function
  - Fixed a little typo in the typedef in the header
  - Updated FreeType lib to v2.0.6

 v1.2
  - Updated FreeType lib to v2.0.5 (that fixed some bugs)
  - Fixed some little typos on the documentation
  - Removed the old alfont_init() and changed the function from
    alfont_init_unusing_atexit() to alfont_init()

 v1.1
  - Made it compatible with Allegro Unicode
  - Fixed a bug in alfont_load_font_from_memory()
  - Added BIG optimizations to the code
  - Added alfont_init_unusing_atexit() function

 v1.0
  - First public release
